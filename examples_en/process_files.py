Help me review and optimize the current page code. When redundant code is found, extract it into subfunctions to ensure adherence to the DRY principle and reduce duplicate or similar code fragments;
* The core principle is to minimize redundant or similar code logic for easier maintenance.
* Keep business logic unchanged. Keep overall style unchanged with minor adjustments allowed.
* When certain parts may overlap with those in other files, consider extracting common parts for reuse;
* If a function body has only one line and no more than 3 parameters, it should be deleted and replaced with concise code at the reference location.
* For html redundancy, extract into snippet fragments.
* For mostly similar but slightly different cases, extract into parameterized reusable functions, components or fragments
