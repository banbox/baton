Based on the existing interface specifications in banexg and references from Binance and OKX, find the required interfaces from bybit_index. When implementing interfaces, read detailed documentation from docs/bybit_v5 based on the interface path.
Always follow the DRY principle during integration, check for redundant or similar code, and extract common parts if any for easier maintenance.

Currently integrating bybit, the {section} part has been completed. Now need to improve unit test cases for this part and ensure tests pass.
Unit tests need two types: one is simple function tests (no API requests); the other is actual interface tests submitted to the exchange (uniformly use `TestApi_` prefix). Can refer to related unit tests in binance;
Then locate the interface file path based on bybit_index and read the detailed interface documentation under docs/bybit_v5.
First ensure the first type of tests are complete and all pass. If there are errors, analyze and resolve them yourself, and repeat testing until they pass.
Then start the second type of tests. These tests should use apiKey and apiSecret configured in local.json to create a valid exchange object, then call actual interface methods to interact with the exchange production environment.
Some of the second type of tests need prior positions, you can first execute a unit test to place orders to create positions, then test related interfaces.
Please only focus on the {section} part. If you are confident that all tests pass without omissions or errors, output <promise>DONE</promise> at the end of the response.

Please first read help.md and contribute.md to understand the architecture and implementation specifications of banexg. Clarify the interfaces that need to be implemented.
Then read bybit_index.md to understand all interfaces provided by bybit;
Then randomly select 7 interface documents under bybit_v5 to read and understand the format characteristics of bybit interface parameters and returned data. Clarify how to handle interface data parsing.
Currently there are mainly two types: binance has completely different interface return data, so each interface can directly define structures for parsing; okx has partially consistent interface return data, such as all nested in the data field, which can reduce code redundancy through generics passing in different parts.
Then according to other requirements in banexg, read the required information outline from bybit documentation by yourself.
Finally, integrate all information and formulate an implementation plan; large blocks of code are prohibited in this plan. Describe step-by-step implementation steps in a concise and condensed style, but task granularity should be small enough and as detailed as possible.
Note that all exchange interfaces and various parameters involved in banexg need to be implemented. Find corresponding ones from interface documentation as much as possible and organize them into bybit_dev
The estimated time for each part should be close. They should be arranged in order according to dependency relationships. Mark completed parts as done.
